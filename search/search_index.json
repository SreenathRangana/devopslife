I'll also provide an alternative process using the \"Import repository\" feature. Method 1: Linking GitHub Repo with Azure Pipeline using a PAT \u00b6 Prerequisites: \u00b6 A GitHub account. A GitHub repository where you have administrative or collaborator access. An Azure DevOps organization and project. A Classic Azure Pipeline created in your project. Step 1: Generate a Personal Access Token (PAT) in GitHub \u00b6 Log in to your GitHub account. Click on your profile picture in the top right corner and select \"Settings.\" In the left sidebar, click on \"Developer settings.\" Under \"Access tokens,\" click on \"Generate token.\" Provide a token description and select the required scopes. At a minimum, select \"repo\" to access repositories. Click \"Generate token,\" and GitHub will generate a PAT. Copy the token; you won't be able to see it again. Step 2: Link GitHub Repo to Azure Pipeline \u00b6 Go to your Azure DevOps project. Navigate to Pipelines > Pipelines. Create a new Classic Pipeline or edit an existing one. Configure your pipeline as needed. Ensure it's set up to trigger on code changes in your GitHub repository. Step 3: Add a Command Line Task \u00b6 In your pipeline configuration, click on \"Tasks.\" Click the \"+\" button to add a new task. Search for \"Command Line\" and select the \"Command Line\" task. Step 4: Configure the Command Line Task \u00b6 In the Command Line task configuration, specify a display name (e.g., \"Run ls command\"). In the \"Script\" field, enter the ls command to list files, for example: ls Below the \"Script\" field, expand the \"Advanced\" section. Check the box for \"Tool Installer,\" and select the version of Node.js you want to use (e.g., \"LTS\"). Step 5: Configure the GitHub PAT as a Secure Variable \u00b6 In your Azure Pipeline, navigate to \"Variables.\" Click on \"New variable\" to add a new variable. Provide a name for the variable (e.g., GITHUB_PAT ) and paste the GitHub PAT you generated in Step 1 as the value. Ensure that the variable is marked as \"Secret\" to keep it secure. Step 6: Use the GitHub PAT in the Pipeline \u00b6 Go back to your pipeline configuration and add a PowerShell or Bash script step that uses the GITHUB_PAT variable as an environment variable. For example, in a PowerShell script step: $env:GITHUB_TOKEN = $( GITHUB_PAT ) In a Bash script step: export GITHUB_TOKEN = $( GITHUB_PAT ) Step 7: Save and Run the Pipeline \u00b6 Save your pipeline configuration. Queue a new build by clicking \"Save\" and then \"Queue\" or trigger it manually.

Permissions determine who can read, write, and execute files, and they are categorized into three groups: owner, group, and others. Users and groups are identified by their respective IDs. User Permissions: Read ( r ): Allows a user to view the content of a file. Write ( w ): Allows a user to modify the content of a file or create new files in a directory. Execute ( x ): Allows a user to run executable files or access directories. For directories, this permission is required to list its contents. Group Permissions: Group permissions work similarly to user permissions but apply to a specific group of users. Users who belong to the group that owns a file or directory inherit the group's permissions. Other Permissions: These permissions apply to all other users who are not the owner or in the group associated with the file or directory. Changing Permissions: - Using Alphabetic Notation: - chmod command is used to change permissions. - Syntax: chmod who=permissions filename/directory - Example: chmod u+rwx,g+rw,o-rx file.txt - u+rwx adds read, write, and execute permissions for the owner. - g+rw adds read and write permissions for the group. - o-rx removes read and execute permissions for others. Using Numeric Notation: Each permission is assigned a numeric value: read (4), write (2), execute (1). Add values to grant permissions and subtract values to revoke permissions. Example: chmod 754 file.txt Owner: read+write+execute (4+2+1 = 7) Group: read+execute (4+1 = 5) Others: read (4) Changing Ownership: - chown command is used to change ownership of files and directories. - Syntax: chown new_owner:new_group filename/directory - Example: chown alice:users file.txt - Changes the owner to user alice and the group to users . Sudo Privilege: - \"sudo\" stands for \"superuser do\" and allows authorized users to execute commands as the superuser or another user, as specified in the sudoers configuration. - Superuser (root) has unrestricted control over the system. - Sudo access provides a balance between security and administrative tasks. - Users with sudo privileges can execute commands requiring elevated privileges by providing their own password. Website Deployment Session Commands: - Updating package lists: sudo apt update - Installing packages: sudo apt install ... -y - Starting Apache: sudo systemctl start apache2 - Enabling automatic Apache start: sudo systemctl enable apache2 - Downloading files: sudo wget ... - Extracting files: sudo unzip ... - Removing files: sudo rm ... - Copying files: sudo cp -r ... - Restarting Apache: sudo systemctl restart apache2 - Checking Apache status: sudo systemctl status apache2 - Displaying text using figlet: figlet done Explanation \u00b6 Command 1: sudo apt update This command updates the package lists for upgrades and updates available on the system.

In this blog post, we'll cover everything you need to know, from creating a GitHub repository to mastering essential Git commands and even understanding architectural concepts. So, let's dive in and demystify these crucial aspects of modern software development. Creating a GitHub Repository and Understanding Key Concepts \u00b6 To start your journey, you need to know how to create a GitHub repository and grasp some fundamental concepts. Creating a GitHub Repository: Login and Navigate: Log in to your GitHub account and click the \"+\" sign in the upper-right corner. Choose \"New Repository.\" Repository Setup: Give your repository a name, add an optional description, select visibility (public or private), and decide whether to initialize with a README (a good practice to provide initial project information). Understanding Key Concepts: Commits: Commits are like snapshots of your project at specific points in time. Each commit represents changes made to files, accompanied by a descriptive commit message. Think of it as saving checkpoints in a game. Branches: Branches allow you to work on separate lines of development without affecting the main codebase. For example, you can create a \"feature\" branch to develop a new feature without disrupting the main code. Using GitHub Pages to Host Your Website \u00b6 GitHub Pages is an excellent tool for hosting static websites directly from your GitHub repository. Steps to Use GitHub Pages: Repository Settings: In your repository, navigate to \"Settings.\" GitHub Pages Section: Scroll down to the \"GitHub Pages\" section. Select Source Branch: Choose the source branch (usually \"main\" or \"master\") from which your website will be built and hosted. Now your website will be accessible via a URL like https://yourusername.github.io/repositoryname . Mastering Essential Git Commands \u00b6 Understanding key Git commands is essential for efficient collaboration and version control. git status : This command provides an overview of your repository's current state. It shows which files are modified, staged, or untracked. git add <filename> : Use this command to stage specific files for the next commit. For example, git add index.html stages the changes made to the index.html file. git add . : This command stages all changes in the current directory. It's a convenient way to prepare multiple changes for a commit. git commit -m \"message\" : After staging changes, commit them with a descriptive message. For instance, git commit -m \"Added login functionality\" records your changes with a relevant message. git push : Push your local commits to the remote repository. Your changes become accessible to collaborators. git pull : Fetch changes from the remote repository and merge them into your local branch. This keeps your local branch up to date. Understanding the Staging Area and Unstaging \u00b6 The staging area (also known as the index) plays a crucial role in crafting meaningful commits. Think of the staging area as a preparation zone. When you make changes to files, they are in an \"unstaged\" state. By using git add , you move these changes to the staging area, preparing them for a commit. If you change your mind, you can \"unstage\" by using git reset . Hosting Multiple Websites on GitHub \u00b6 You can host multiple websites from different repositories on GitHub Pages. Distinct Repositories: Ensure each website has its own repository with a unique name. GitHub Pages Settings: In each repository, navigate to \"Settings\" and configure GitHub Pages. Choose the source branch specific to that website. Monolithic vs. Microservices Architecture \u00b6 Understanding architecture is vital. Let's differentiate between monolithic and microservices architecture. Monolithic Architecture: Imagine a traditional brick-and-mortar store where all departments are under one roof. In software, this is akin to having all components tightly integrated into a single codebase. Microservices Architecture: Think of an online marketplace where different sellers operate independently. In software, this translates to breaking an application into smaller, loosely-coupled services. Real-Life Examples: Monolithic: Consider an email application where everything\u2014inbox, drafts, sent items\u2014is within one application. Microservices: Picture a food delivery app where separate services handle user registration, restaurant management, and order processing. Conclusion \u00b6 In this comprehensive guide, we've covered the basics of Git and GitHub, how to create repositories, use GitHub Pages, and master essential Git commands. Additionally, we explored the staging area, hosting multiple websites on GitHub, and the difference between monolithic and microservices architecture. Remember, practice makes perfect. So, roll up your sleeves, create repositories, experiment with branches, and explore the world of collaborative software development.

The root directory (\"/\") is the top-level directory from which all other directories and files stem. Directories are used to organize and group files into logical categories. Files are organized based on their type, and they can be text files, binary files, directories, device files, and more. All Types of Directories: Directories in Linux can be categorized as system directories (critical for system operation), user directories (for user-specific data), and temporary directories (for temporary files). Examples of system directories include \"/bin\", \"/etc\", \"/lib\", \"/usr\", etc. User directories like \"/home/username\" store user-specific data and configurations. Temporary directories like \"/tmp\" hold temporary files that can be safely deleted. VIM Editor and Its Modes: Vim is a powerful text editor available in most Unix-like systems. Vim has different modes: Normal mode (default mode for navigation and manipulation), Insert mode (for text input), Visual mode (for selecting text), and Command-line mode (for entering commands). To switch from Normal mode to Insert mode, press \"i\". To switch back to Normal mode from Insert mode, press \"Esc\". In Normal mode, you can navigate using arrow keys or \"hjkl\" keys, perform editing operations, and execute commands. In Command-line mode, you can save changes with \":w\", quit with \":q\", and save and quit with \":wq\". How to Insert, Write, Quit in VIM: To insert text in Vim, first switch to Insert mode by pressing \"i\". Then, type your text. After inserting text, switch back to Normal mode by pressing \"Esc\". To save changes, type \":w\" in Normal mode and press \"Enter\". To quit Vim, type \":q\" in Normal mode and press \"Enter\". If you want to save and quit, type \":wq\" and press \"Enter\". Variable Path and Actual Path in Linux: In Linux, a \"variable path\" usually refers to a variable containing a directory path that can change. An \"actual path\" refers to the absolute and unchanging directory path to a specific location in the file system. For example, if you have a variable $HOME that stores the path to the user's home directory, its value might change for different users, but the actual path (e.g., \"/home/username\") remains fixed. Here are the notes for the unique commands from your history, excluding the repeated ones: \u00b6 clear : Clears the terminal screen. logout : Logs out of the current user session. ls / : Lists the contents of the root directory. pwd : Prints the current working directory. ls /home : Lists the contents of the /home directory. touch teja.txt : Creates an empty file named teja.txt in the current directory. vi teja.txt : Opens the teja.txt file in the Vim editor for editing. vi ravi.txt : Attempts to open a file named ravi.txt in the Vim editor. cat ravi.txt : Displays the contents of the ravi.txt file using cat . cat ravi.txt : Displays the contents of the ravi.txt file again. ls /home/ : Lists the contents of the /home directory. sudo adduser teja : Adds a user named teja using sudo . cd /home/teja/ : Changes the working directory to /home/teja . sudo -i : Opens a new shell session with superuser privileges. mkdir sample : Creates a directory named sample in the current directory. touch 1 2 3 4 : Creates empty files named 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 . mkdir -p stevejobs/apple/ios : Creates a directory structure. ls stevejobs/ : Lists the contents of the stevejobs directory. ls stevejobs/apple/ : Lists the contents of the apple directory within stevejobs . cd ios/ : Changes the current working directory to ios within apple . touch iphone11 : Creates a file named iphone11 in the ios directory. touch /home/ubuntu/stevejobs/apple/ios/iphone12 : Creates a file at the specified path. vi /home/ubuntu/stevejobs/apple/ios/iphone12 : Opens the iphone12 file in the Vim editor. cat /home/ubuntu/stevejobs/apple/ios/iphone12 : Displays the contents of iphone12 using cat . mv sample/ stevejobs/ : Moves the sample directory to stevejobs . history : Displays the command history.","title":"Linux-FileSystems"},{"location":"devops/Linux_File_system_and_VIM/#here-are-the-notes-for-the-unique-commands-from-your-history-excluding-the-repeated-ones","text":"clear : Clears the terminal screen. logout : Logs out of the current user session. ls / : Lists the contents of the root directory. pwd : Prints the current working directory. ls /home : Lists the contents of the /home directory. touch teja.txt : Creates an empty file named teja.txt in the current directory. vi teja.txt : Opens the teja.txt file in the Vim editor for editing. vi ravi.txt : Attempts to open a file named ravi.txt in the Vim editor. cat ravi.txt : Displays the contents of the ravi.txt file using cat . cat ravi.txt : Displays the contents of the ravi.txt file again. ls /home/ : Lists the contents of the /home directory. sudo adduser teja : Adds a user named teja using sudo . cd /home/teja/ : Changes the working directory to /home/teja . sudo -i : Opens a new shell session with superuser privileges. mkdir sample : Creates a directory named sample in the current directory. touch 1 2 3 4 : Creates empty files named 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 . mkdir -p stevejobs/apple/ios : Creates a directory structure. ls stevejobs/ : Lists the contents of the stevejobs directory. ls stevejobs/apple/ : Lists the contents of the apple directory within stevejobs . cd ios/ : Changes the current working directory to ios within apple . touch iphone11 : Creates a file named iphone11 in the ios directory. touch /home/ubuntu/stevejobs/apple/ios/iphone12 : Creates a file at the specified path. vi /home/ubuntu/stevejobs/apple/ios/iphone12 : Opens the iphone12 file in the Vim editor. cat /home/ubuntu/stevejobs/apple/ios/iphone12 : Displays the contents of iphone12 using cat . mv sample/ stevejobs/ : Moves the sample directory to stevejobs . history : Displays the command history.","title":"Here are the notes for the unique commands from your history, excluding the repeated ones:"},{"location":"devops/ansible/","text":"Ansible \u00b6 Ansible is an open source IT Configuration Management, Deployment & Orchestration tool.

It is a java based web application server so we need to setup first java on the machine to run jenkins server. Jenkins CI CD Automation \u00b6 Jenkins 1 st Pipeline \u00b6 Setting up a freestyle pipeline in Jenkins to link your Git public repository and run the ls command in a bash shell is a straightforward process. Here are the detailed steps: Prerequisites: \u00b6 Jenkins installed and configured. A public Git repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket). Administrative access to your Jenkins instance. Step 1: Install Required Plugins (if not already installed) \u00b6 In your Jenkins dashboard, click on \"Manage Jenkins\" in the left sidebar. Click on \"Manage Plugins.\" Go to the \"Available\" tab and search for and install the following plugins if they are not already installed: Git Plugin: For Git integration. Build Timeout Plugin (optional but recommended): To set a time limit for the build. After installing the plugins, Jenkins may ask you to restart. If so, follow the prompts to restart Jenkins. Step 2: Create a New Freestyle Project \u00b6 In your Jenkins dashboard, click on \"New Item\" in the left sidebar. Enter a name for your project (e.g., \"MyFreestylePipeline\") and select \"Freestyle project.\" Click \"OK\" to create the project. Step 3: Configure Source Code Management (Git) \u00b6 In the project configuration page, scroll down to the \"Source Code Management\" section. Select \"Git.\" In the \"Repository URL\" field, enter the URL of your public Git repository. You can leave the \"Branches to build\" field empty to build the default branch (e.g., main or master ). If your Git repository requires credentials, click the \"Add\" button next to \"Credentials\" and enter your Git credentials. If it's a public repository, you may not need credentials. Click \"Save\" at the bottom of the page. Step 4: Configure Build Actions (Run ls Command) \u00b6 Scroll down to the \"Build\" section in your project configuration. Click the \"Add build step\" dropdown and select \"Execute shell\" (for running bash commands). In the \"Command\" text area, enter the ls command or any other bash command you want to run, e.g.: ls Optionally, you can add more build steps or post-build actions as needed. Click \"Save\" at the bottom of the page. Step 5: Build the Freestyle Pipeline \u00b6 In your Jenkins dashboard, locate your newly created freestyle project (\"MyFreestylePipeline\" or whatever you named it). Click on the project name. In the project page, click \"Build Now\" to trigger a build. Jenkins will clone your Git repository, execute the ls command, and display the build output in the console. That's it! You've set up a freestyle pipeline in Jenkins that links to your public Git repository and runs the ls command in a bash shell. You can further customize your pipeline with additional build steps, post-build actions, and integration with other tools as needed.

This guide will walk you through the steps, detailing the roles and responsibilities of both the Dev Team and DevOps Team. Step-by-Step Guide with Roles and Responsibilities \u00b6 Step 1: Analyze the Existing Monolithic Application \ud83d\udd0d \u00b6 Dev Team Responsibilities: \u00b6 Identify Services: Determine which parts of the application can be separated into individual services. Dependencies: Map out the dependencies between these parts. Example: Suppose your application is an e-commerce platform with three main services: - User Service: Handles user authentication and profile management. \ud83d\udc64 - Product Service: Manages product catalog and inventory. \ud83d\udce6 - Order Service: Processes customer orders. \ud83d\uded2 Step 2: Design the Microservices \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f \u00b6 Dev Team Responsibilities: \u00b6 Define Boundaries: Clearly define the boundaries of each microservice. APIs: Design the APIs for each microservice, ensuring they can communicate with each other as needed. Example: - User Service API: Endpoints for user registration, login, and profile updates. \ud83d\udd11 - Product Service API: Endpoints for listing products, adding new products, and updating inventory. \ud83d\udccb - Order Service API: Endpoints for placing orders, viewing order status, and managing orders. \ud83d\udce6 Step 3: Refactor the Codebase \ud83d\udd28 \u00b6 Dev Team Responsibilities: \u00b6 Extract Services: Extract the code for each service from the monolithic codebase into separate repositories. Database Separation: If possible, separate the databases for each service. If not, create logical separations within a single database. Example: - Extract user-related functionalities and move them to a separate repository for the User Service. \ud83d\udc64 - Similarly, move product and order-related functionalities to their respective repositories. \ud83d\udce6\ud83d\uded2 Step 4: Containerize Each Microservice \ud83d\udc33 \u00b6 Dev Team Responsibilities: \u00b6 Create Dockerfiles: Write Dockerfiles for each microservice. Example: Dockerfile for User Service: # User Service Dockerfile FROM node:14 WORKDIR /app COPY package*.json ./ RUN npm install COPY . . EXPOSE 3000 CMD [ \"node\" , \"server.js\" ] Build Docker Images: Build Docker images for each service. docker build -t user-service:latest ./user-service docker build -t product-service:latest ./product-service docker build -t order-service:latest ./order-service Step 5: Configure Helm Charts \ud83d\udcdc \u00b6 DevOps Team Responsibilities: \u00b6 Create Separate Helm Charts: Create Helm charts for each microservice. Example: Directory structure for User Service Helm chart: user-service/ Chart.yaml values.yaml templates/ deployment.yaml service.yaml Define Kubernetes Resources: Write Kubernetes deployment and service definitions in the Helm chart templates. Example: deployment.yaml for User Service: apiVersion : apps/v1 kind : Deployment metadata : name : user-service spec : replicas : 3 selector : matchLabels : app : user-service template : metadata : labels : app : user-service spec : containers : - name : user-service image : user-service:latest ports : - containerPort : 3000 env : - name : DATABASE_URL value : \"mongodb://mongo:27017/userdb\" Step 6: Deploy to Kubernetes \ud83d\ude80 \u00b6 DevOps Team Responsibilities: \u00b6 Deploy Each Service: Use Helm to deploy each microservice to your Kubernetes cluster. helm install user-service ./user-service helm install product-service ./product-service helm install order-service ./order-service Inter-Service Communication: Ensure services can communicate with each other, typically via Kubernetes Services. Example: In the order-service deployment, add an environment variable to point to the User Service: env : - name : USER_SERVICE_URL value : \"http://user-service:3000\" Step 7: Update and Monitor \ud83d\udd04\ud83d\udcca \u00b6 Dev Team Responsibilities: \u00b6 Update APIs: Ensure the application is updated to use the new microservices APIs. DevOps Team Responsibilities: \u00b6 Monitor Services: Use monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana to monitor the health and performance of each microservice. Real-Time Example \ud83c\udf10 \u00b6 Let\u2019s say you have the monolithic application currently deployed as a single Kubernetes deployment: apiVersion : apps/v1 kind : Deployment metadata : name : monolithic-app spec : replicas : 3 selector : matchLabels : app : monolithic-app template : metadata : labels : app : monolithic-app spec : containers : - name : app image : monolithic-app:latest ports : - containerPort : 8080 env : - name : DATABASE_URL value : \"mongodb://mongo:27017/appdb\" After following the steps, you would have three separate deployments, one for each microservice. Summary \ud83d\udcdd \u00b6 Dev Team: \u00b6 Analyze the monolith to identify services. \ud83d\udd0d Design and refactor the codebase. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f\ud83d\udd28 Containerize each service. \ud83d\udc33 Update APIs to reflect the new microservices architecture. \ud83d\udd04 DevOps Team: \u00b6 Create Helm charts for each service. \ud83d\udcdc Deploy services individually using Helm. \ud83d\ude80 Monitor the services using tools like Prometheus and Grafana. \ud83d\udcca By following these steps and clearly delineating the roles and responsibilities, you can effectively transition your monolithic application into a scalable and manageable microservices architecture in Kubernetes.","title":"Microservices"},{"location":"devops/microservices/#transitioning-from-a-monolithic-to-microservices-architecture-in-kubernetes","text":"Migrating from a monolithic application to a microservices architecture in Kubernetes is a complex but rewarding process.

It allows you to customize your shell environment by defining aliases, functions, variables, and more. Here's how you can use .bashrc to create aliases: Open your terminal. Use a text editor like nano or vim to edit your .bashrc file. The file is usually located in your home directory. Add alias definitions at the end of the file, like this: alias ll = 'ls -l' alias update = 'sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade' Save the file and exit the text editor. To apply the changes, either restart your terminal or run source ~/.bashrc . Now, you can use the aliases you defined in your terminal. For example, ll will be equivalent to ls -l . Usage of Command Line Arguments in Bash Script: \u00b6 Command line arguments allow you to pass input values to a Bash script when executing it. They are accessed using special variables: $1 , $2 , $3 , ..., where $1 represents the first argument, $2 the second, and so on. Here are a few more details about command line arguments: $0 : Name of the script itself. $# : Number of arguments passed. $@ : All arguments as a list. $* : All arguments as a single string. Example usage in a script named myscript.sh : #!/bin/bash echo \"Script name: $0 \" echo \"Number of arguments: $# \" echo \"Arguments list: $@ \" echo \"Arguments as string: $* \" When you run ./myscript.sh arg1 arg2 arg3 , the script will output: Script name: ./myscript.sh Number of arguments: 3 Arguments list: arg1 arg2 arg3 Arguments as string: arg1 arg2 arg3 Conditional Statements: if-else and elif: \u00b6 Conditional statements allow you to make decisions in your scripts based on conditions. The most common conditional statements are if , else , and elif (short for \"else if\"). Here's their structure: if condition ; then # Code to execute if condition is true elif another_condition ; then # Code to execute if another_condition is true else # Code to execute if none of the conditions are true fi Example: #!/bin/bash age = 25 if [ \" $age \" -lt 18 ] ; then echo \"You're a minor.\" elif [ \" $age \" -ge 18 ] && [ \" $age \" -lt 65 ] ; then echo \"You're an adult.\" else echo \"You're a senior.\" fi Loops: for and while: \u00b6 Loops allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly.

Export Command Usage in Linux: \u00b6 The export command is used to set environment variables that are accessible to child processes of the current shell. This is often used to make certain variables available to other scripts or programs you run. Example: #!/bin/bash # Set an environment variable export MY_VAR = \"Hello, world!\" # Run another script that uses the environment variable ./another_script.sh In another_script.sh : #!/bin/bash echo \"Value of MY_VAR: $MY_VAR \" When running the main script, it will set the environment variable, and the another_script.sh will be able to access its value using $MY_VAR .
